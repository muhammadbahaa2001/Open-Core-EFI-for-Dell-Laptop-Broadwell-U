# Open-Core-EFI-for-Dell-Laptop-Broadwell-U
This EFI made and tested for Dell Inspiron 5558.
This EFI is very exclusive, you might not able to find one like this, since Dortania Guide for building Open Core EFI includes all Intel generations whether desktop or laptop, but it doesn't include all all Intel architectures (Broadwell-U)
